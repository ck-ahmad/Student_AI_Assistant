Subnetting is the process of dividing a single, large physical network into smaller, logical sub-networks or "subnets."

**Why Subnet?**
*   **Improve Performance:** Reduces overall network traffic and congestion by creating smaller broadcast domains.
*   **Enhance Security:** Allows you to isolate networks and control traffic flow between them.
*   **Simplify Management:** Makes a large network easier to manage and troubleshoot.

### **Core Concepts**

*   **IP Address:** Has two parts: the **Network ID** (identifies the network) and the **Host ID** (identifies a specific device on that network).

*   **Subnet Mask:** A 32-bit number that separates the Network ID from the Host ID.
    *   The `1`s in the mask represent the network portion.
    *   The `0`s in the mask represent the host portion.
    *   *Example:* `255.255.255.0`

*   **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Notation:** A shorthand method for writing the subnet mask.
    *   The number after the slash (e.g., `/24`) indicates how many bits are used for the network portion.
    *   *Example:* `192.168.1.0 /24` is the same as using the subnet mask `255.255.255.0`.

### **How It Works: "Borrowing Bits"**

Subnetting is done by "borrowing" bits from the Host ID portion of the IP address and adding them to the Network ID portion.

*   **The Trade-off:**
    *   **More bits borrowed** → **More subnets**, but **Fewer hosts** per subnet.
    *   **Fewer bits borrowed** → **Fewer subnets**, but **More hosts** per subnet.

### **Special Addresses in Every Subnet**

Two addresses in every subnet are reserved and cannot be assigned to devices:

*   **Network Address:**
    *   The very first IP address in a subnet.
    *   It identifies the subnet itself. (All host bits are `0`).

*   **Broadcast Address:**
    *   The very last IP address in a subnet.
    *   Used to send a message to all devices on that specific subnet. (All host bits are `1`).
