## 1. Gemini Model Errors

### ❌ Problem

Notes AI was not responding. Error:

```
404 models/gemini-pro is not found
```

### ✅ Fix

Changed model name:

```python
# Old
self.model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')

# New
self.model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.0-flash-exp')
```

✅ Result: Notes generation works perfectly.

## 2. File Upload & Access Issues

### ❌ Problem

* File uploaded but could not open
* URL contained unwanted characters (`%05`)
* No API route to serve the file

### ✅ Fix

#### ✅ Added file view route

```python
@app.route('/api/drive/file/<file_id>')
def get_file(file_id):
    file_path = drive_manager.get_file_path(file_id)
    if file_path:
        return send_file(file_path, as_attachment=False)
    return jsonify({'error': 'File not found'}), 404
```

#### ✅ Added download route

```python
@app.route('/api/drive/download/<file_id>')
def download_file(file_id):
    file_path = drive_manager.get_file_path(file_id)
    if file_path:
        return send_file(file_path, as_attachment=True)
    return jsonify({'error': 'File not found'}), 404
```

✅ Result: Local and cloud files open and download correctly.

---

## 3. Translation Problems

### ❌ Problem

`googletrans` was crashing:

```
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
```

### ✅ Fix

Replaced with `deep-translator`:

```python
from deep_translator import GoogleTranslator

translator = GoogleTranslator(source='auto', target='ur')
translated = translator.translate(text)
```

✅ Result: Translation works smoothly.

---

## 4. Cloudinary Upload Failures

### ❌ Problem

Cloudinary rejected file names with special characters:

```
public_id is invalid
```

### ✅ Fix

Sanitized filenames and detected correct file types:

```python
resource_type = "raw"  # for PDFs and documents
```

✅ Result: All files upload and display correctly.

---

## 5. AI Pipeline Crashes

### ❌ Problem

When many users called AI at the same time:

* Requests crashed
* Connection pool overloaded

### ✅ Fix

* Added async executor
* Added retry system with backoff
* Limited requests per minute

✅ Result: AI now handles multiple users without crashing.

---

## 6. File Path Issues

### ❌ Problem

Windows path issues and missing `send_file` import.

### ✅ Fix

Used cross-platform paths:

```python
local_path = os.path.join(self.local_storage, semester, degree, subject)
```

✅ Result: Files work on both Windows and Linux.

---

## 7. Session & Authentication Problems

### ❌ Problem

* Sessions not saving
* Login disappearing
* Missing secret key

### ✅ Fix

```python
app.secret_key = secrets.token_hex(16)
session.permanent = True
```

Added login required decorator.

✅ Result: Sessions stay logged in properly.

---

## 8. Filename Special Characters

### ❌ Problem

Names like `Design & Algo.pdf` caused upload failure.

### ✅ Fix

Sanitized file names:

```python
safe_name = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '_', name)
```

✅ Result: All file names upload safely.
