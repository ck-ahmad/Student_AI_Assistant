*   **Definition:** A highly efficient, in-place, comparison-based sorting algorithm.

*   **Core Strategy: Divide and Conquer**
    1.  **Pick a Pivot:** Select an element from the array (e.g., the last element).
    2.  **Partition:** Reorder the array so that all elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it, and all elements greater are placed after it. The pivot is now in its final sorted position.
    3.  **Recurse:** Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays of elements on both sides of the pivot.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **In-place:** Sorts the array without requiring significant additional memory.
    *   **Unstable:** The relative order of equal elements is not guaranteed to be preserved.

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   **Best & Average Case:** O(n log n)
    *   **Worst Case:** O(n²) — Occurs when the pivot is consistently the smallest or largest element, often in a pre-sorted array.
