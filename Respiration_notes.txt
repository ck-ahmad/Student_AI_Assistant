Cellular respiration is the chemical process that releases energy from glucose (food) in living cells.

*   **Purpose:** To produce ATP, the energy currency that powers all life activities.
*   **Location:** Occurs in the mitochondria of cells.
*   **Word Equation:**
    Glucose + Oxygen â†’ Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy (ATP)

#### **Two Main Types:**

*   **Aerobic Respiration:**
    *   Requires oxygen.
    *   Releases a large amount of energy.
    *   The primary method of respiration in most organisms.

*   **Anaerobic Respiration:**
    *   Occurs without oxygen.
    *   Releases a much smaller amount of energy.
    *   Example: Lactic acid production in muscles during intense exercise.

**Key Distinction:**

*   **Breathing (Gas Exchange):** The physical process of taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide.
*   **Respiration:** The chemical reaction inside cells that uses oxygen to break down food for energy.
